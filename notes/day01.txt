Git Day 1 Notes:
git hash-object -w --stdin
  This will output a sha1 for the data inputted

git cat-file -p <sha1>
  Will cat the file with the given sha1 tag. Can just use the prefix of sha1.

git can store:
  blobs (chunks of data/files)
  trees (directories)

Note: If sha1 are different, they will be dramatically different.

Adding a file to a tree will generate a new sha1 data for the directory. Data can never leave the system.

The sha1 of the root directory can reconstruct the entire directory given that there is a way to map sha1 to file data.

No duplication is stored in git. If the content of the file is the same, the sha1 will remain the same.
