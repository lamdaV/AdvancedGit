Rebase
  Suppose we have the commit chain as so

  c1 <-- c2 <-- c3
     \
      \- b1

  Suppose that b1 was committed before c2, c3.
  Now what if the two branches are completely different from each other.
  We can imagine that it commit chain could be like so:

  c1 <-- b1 <-- c2 <-- c3

  We could get the deltas, changes from one commit to the other, from c2 to c1 (c2') and c3 to c1 (c3').
  We then could just apply those deltas to b1.

  This is a rebase
  Command:
    git checkout c_branch (this branch becomes the delta to me applied to master)
    git rebase master

  Rebase should be done in your own local history. It should not be done on the shared repo.
